[![Blank Screen](gett-detail.png)](https://icncomputer.com/blank-screen/)

When a black screen in Windows 10 error occurs, the computer may still be on and functioning, but it may be frozen and incapable of accepting inputs, or it may just be off. A black screen in Windows 10 can appear at any time during use, immediately after booting, after or during an update due to a Windows update error, and at virtually any other time.

## Causes of a Black Screen on FaceTime

**_There are several reasons for a black screen on FaceTime. The issue could be something as simple as a software setting to a hardware failure. Here are some potential causes for a black screen on FaceTime:_**

* The camera is off or disabled.
* The camera isn't working.
* The camera is in use by another app.
* Something is obstructing the camera lens.
* A poor or no internet connection.

## How to Fix FaceTime Black Screen Issues

* Is this an audio-only call? Check that you haven't accidentally chosen an audio-only call. When you make an audio-only call, you see a FaceTime button in the middle of the screen when speaking. Select this button to switch to a video call.
* Is the camera lens blocked? Check that you or your caller aren't blocking the camera lens. It can sometimes happen when a misplaced thumb or finger puts the device's camera out of action, leaving you with a black screen.
* Which camera are you using? Check to see which camera is selected. You might have the front camera enabled instead of the selfie camera.
* Have you turned off the device lately? If not, restart your iPhone or restart your iPad. Yes, this is another simple option, but it sometimes works, given that restarts close all open apps. It might be what's needed to get FaceTime working correctly again.
* Is the camera busy? Check that another app isn't using your device's camera. If one is, close the app to get the FaceTime video working again.
* Check your internet connection. One possible reason your FaceTime video isn't working is that your internet connection is experiencing a problem or isn't particularly strong. If you use a Wi-Fi network, ensure you're as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible.
* Check that you or your caller doesn't have a restriction on FaceTime. You and the other caller should go to Settings and check Restrictions (in iOS 11 or earlier systems, via General) or Screen Time (in iOS 12 or later).
* See if you need to update your MacBook or download and install the latest iOS update. Updates can resolve underlying software issues that may cause a FaceTime black screen.
* If you still experience issues, factory reset your iPhone, Mac, or iPad. Doing this is drastic, so only do it after backing up your device.
* Make an Apple Store appointment or go to an authorized repair shop.
